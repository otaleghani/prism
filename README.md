> **Your OS, refracted into a state-first, fully reproducible experience.**

**Prism** is an opinionated [NixOS](https://nixos.org/) distribution designed to solve system entropy. It takes your operating system—kernel, drivers, UI, and packages—and "refracts" it into distinct, isolated personas like **Developer**, **Gamer**, and **Creator**.

Powered by [Nix Flakes](https://nixos.wiki/wiki/Flakes), [Hyprland](https://hyprland.org/), and a bespoke [Quickshell](https://github.com/outfoxxed/quickshell) desktop environment, Prism ensures that every pixel and process is defined as code. Update atomically, rollback instantly, and never configure your machine twice.

Take a look at the [documentation](https://prism.talesign.com) to get started.
