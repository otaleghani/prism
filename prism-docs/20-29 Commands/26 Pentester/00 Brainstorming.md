- **`prism-net-recon`**: A script that prompts for an IP/Range and runs a "safe" default Nmap scan, outputting the results directly to a markdown file in a `~/Notes/Targets` directory.
- **`prism-vpn-quick`**: A TUI to quickly switch between OpenVPN or WireGuard profiles specifically for HTB (HackTheBox) or TryHackMe environments.
- **`prism-listener`**: A tool that asks for a port and instantly spawns a `netcat` or `pwncat` listener in a floating terminal, pre-configured with the correct window class for easy monitoring.
- **`prism-target-set`**: The "Global variable" script. You input an IP or Domain, and the script saves it to `/tmp/prism_target`. Every other pentest script then uses this value as the default.
- **`prism-port-scan`**: A guided `nmap` wizard. It asks for the scan intensity (Stealth, Fast, Full) and automatically targets the IP set in `prism-target-set`.
- **`prism-shell-gen`**: A "Reverse Shell" generator. Choose your language (Python, Bash, PHP, Perl), enter your IP/Port, and it copies the payload to your clipboard instantly.
- **`prism-hash-id`**: A TUI wrapper for `hash-identifier`. Paste a hash, and it tells you if it’s MD5, SHA-256, or Bcrypt, then offers to launch a wordlist attack.
- **`prism-listener`**: Quickly spawns a `netcat` or `pwncat` listener on a specified port in a floating terminal, pre-configured with the correct window class so it doesn't get buried.
