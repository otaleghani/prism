# Themes

Add brief explaination of how themes work.

## Quirks

### fzf
fzf themes are handled by envariment variables, so they won't update when you change your theme! To do that, you just need to open a new terminal or run the following:
```bash
source ~/.zshrc
```

### yazi
yazi config is handled by using a symlink, which means you need to close yazi and reopen to see the theme being applied.
