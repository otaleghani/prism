# Overrides

## Dotfiles
The user can use the `prism-save` command to save the overrides into the correct folder. This will save the dotfiles in subsequential updates.

## Themes and wallpapers
Users need to add into the prism configuration the overrides for their user.
For themes the folder is `/etc/prism/overrides/USERNAME/themes`
For wallpapers the folder is `/etc/prism/overrides/USERNAME/wallpapers`
